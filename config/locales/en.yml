      photos_how: Have someone take a picture of you from the front. If you have no choice, take a selfie, but it's hard to get a good angle with a selfie. Wear a tight fitting shirt, or if you're comfortable, no shirt at all. The more the tailors can see of your body. the better they can make a shirt that fits.
      photos_door: If possible, stand in front of a door. This will help us standardize your picture.
